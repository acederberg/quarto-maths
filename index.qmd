This is my quarto blog! Here I will write blog posts about 
``python``, containerization, infrastructure as code, numerical mathematics, 
data structures and algorithms, and data science.

on twitter. If you find any errors in my blog posts, please make an issue on
[the github repository for this wibsite](https://github.com/acederberg/quarto-maths).
