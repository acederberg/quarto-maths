It is possible to include code files using the [include-code-files](
https://github.com/quarto-ext/include-code-files) extension for quarto. I 
started doing this [from this stack exchange post](
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75751478/how-can-i-include-external-python-scripts-while-executing-their-codes-in-quarto). 
For more on adding extensions, see [the documentation about extensions management](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/managing.html).

First, in the front matter of your quarto document, add 


```yaml
filters:
  - include-code-files
```


Next, create ``example.py`` like


```sh
echo "def main():" > example.py
echo "  print(\"It works!\")" >> example.py
echo "" >> example.py
echo "if __name__ == \"__main__\": main()" >> example.py
```

and ensure it works using

```sh
python ./example.py
```


To include this file in simply do:


````quarto
```{.python include="example.py"}
```
````


which should render to


```{.python include="example.py"}
```


``example.py`` can be run using the ``run`` jupyter magic commands:


```{python}
#| echo: false
%run example.py
```


More about magic commands is available in the [jupyter documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html).
Finally, with ``main`` in the local python globals, we can execute ``main``.


```{python}
main()
```
