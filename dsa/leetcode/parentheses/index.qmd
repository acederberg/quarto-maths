Divide and conquer! A big subproblem can be made into many subproblems.


```default
Main problem becomes subproblems

      2+3*5-4 -> 2+3*(5-4)
     /       \
(2+3)*5-4    2+(3*5)-4

The subproblems become complete expressions:


         (2+3)*5-4           
          /     \             
(2+3)*(5-4)    ((2+3)*5)-4
 
         2+(3*5)-4        
          /     \             
(2+(3*5))-4     2+((3*5)-4)
                ^^^^^^^^^^^ A


         2+3*(5-4) 
        /         \
2+(3*(5-4))       2+(3*(5-4))
^^^^^^^^^^^ A


some answers match and are ommited.

(2+3)*(5-4)     = 5 * 1
((2+3)*5)-4     = 25 - 4
(2+(3*5))-4     = 17 - 4
2+((3*5)-4)     = 2 + 11

2+(3*(5-4))     = 6
2+(3*(5-4))

```


The next question is how to parse this.
