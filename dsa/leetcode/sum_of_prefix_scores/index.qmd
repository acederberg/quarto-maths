## Analysis

### Dynamic Programming Solution

This is pretty clearly a situation where using a trie is very helpful. I 
already implemented a trie for yesterdays problem but decided to update the 
``terminates`` attribute to keep count of repeated additions since repeats may 
show up in the list. More or less, the answer is the sum  of ``terminates`` on 
the subtree for each prefix for each word. For instance

```yaml
words: ["ab", "abc", "abf", "b", "bc"]
drawing: |
             a  b
            /   ^\
           b      c
          /^\     ^
         c   f
         ^   ^
solution: [6, 7, 1, 2, 3]
#[3 + 3, 3 + 3 + 1, 3 + 3 + 1, 2, 2 + 1]
```


#### Counting the Number of Entries for a Subtree.

1. Given a prefix, the tree should be traversed until this prefix is matched. 
   If it is not, then return 0.

2. Count the number of terminating nodes on the subtrees.


#### Counting the Number of Entries for a Subree for a Word

1. Start with the longest prefix. Count all entries bellow and memoize or use 
   memoized result. 
2. Truncate the prefix by one. Count all entries bellow that. This will involve
   calculating entries in any sibling trees, which should be remembered.
3. Repeat 2.


#### Repeated Words

When a word is repeated, it is useful to use the ``terminates`` attribute as an 
integer.


### Improved Solution

Since the ``terminates`` value is incremented every time a value that has 
occured is reinserted, then it makes since to make a trie of prefixes, e.g.

```
  a   ->       a   ->    a
 /^           /^        /^
b 1          b 2       b 3
^           /^        /^\
1          c 2       c 3 f
           ^         ^   ^
           1         1   1
```


and determine the sum over the path to each word.


## Solution

The trie implementation is as follows:

```{.python include="../longest_pfx/__init__.py" snippet="trie_min"}

```

### The Top Down Dynamic Programming Solution

The following solution works, but can be optimized. Unfortunately, in one case 
the solution ran out of memory. This goes to show that dynamic programming is
not always the solution.

```{.python include="__init__.py" snippet="solution_initial"}
```


### The Improved Solution

This solution placed in the $50\%$ quantile of runtime and $70\%$ quantile of
runtime:

```{.python include="__init__.py" snippet="solutiond"}
```
