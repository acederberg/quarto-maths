[See the explanation on leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences).


This problem is almost trivial - there are just some strange things about 
non-deterministic runtimes and test cases. For instance, I found that the 
following solution scored very well on some runs but terribly in other runs

```python
class Solution:
    def uncommonFromSentences(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> list[str]:

        if s1 == s2:
            return list()
            
        all = s1.split(" ") + s2.split(" ")

        counts = dict()

        for word in all:
            counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1

        return list(word for word, count in counts.items() if count == 1)
```

Futher the garding statement results in an incredible increase in performance,
which says more about the test cases than anything. 

```{.python include="__init__.py" snippet="solution_initial"}
```

After seeing how poorly this performed, I looked at a number of submissions
and the submissions did not appear to apply much different algorithms. I then
decided to rerun another submission to find that it did not perform as well as 
on the submission.
