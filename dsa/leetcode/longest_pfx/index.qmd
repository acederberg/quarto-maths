### Trivial Solution

The trivial solution was terribly slow and timed out. Here it is.

```{.python include="__init__.py" snippet="solution_trivial"}
```


### Trie Solution

Using a trie is very effective since it takes linear time to build the trie
and linear time to search it. First, below is the trie implementation:


```{.python include="__init__.py" snippet="trie"}
```


This places in the $59\%$ for runtime $30\%$ quantile for memory.
