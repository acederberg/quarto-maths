title: Determine if a Binary Tree is Balanced.

## Solutions

## Initial Solution


My initial solution did not rank very well. It ranked in the $15\%$ quantile 
for runtime and $22\%$ for memory.

## Improved Solution

A few obvious optomizations can be made - for instance if the left tree is not
balanced, then it is not necessary to check if the right tree is also balanced.

I decided to look at some other solutions to see what optimizations could be 
made. One in particular that I liked returned ``-1`` to indicate that a subtree
was not balanced - this simplified the return type of the function and made it 
necessary to compute the height at node only once the heights of both children
were known and once it was known that the tree was balanced.


This solution was far more performant in its runtime in the $79\%$ quantile but 
with memory still at a sad $22\%$.
