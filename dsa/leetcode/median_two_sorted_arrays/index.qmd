## Analysis of the Problem

The basics of the algorithm are actually very straightforward - it is the edge
cases and implementation that made this quite tricky. Given the finite subsets 
$\{a_j\}$ and $\{b_k\}$ of $N$ indexed in monotonic order, the algorithm is  

1. Take $j_{start} = max(j)$ and $j_{stop} = min(j)$, and likewise for $k_{start}$
   and $k_{stop}$.
2. If $j_{start} <= j_{stop}$ and $k_{start} <= k_{stop}$, look at the repective elements
   for the starts and choose the lesser element - for this element increment 
   the corresponding value of $j_{start}$ or $k_{start}$ and record the lesser 
   element $r$ - then look at the respective elements of the stops and choose 
   the greater and save it as $l$ - for this element decrement the 
   corresponding value of $j_{stop}$ or $k_{stop}$. 

   If one array has been expended, just do this for just the remaining array.
   If both have been expended, stop.

3. Repeat step 2 until $j_{start} > j_{stop}$ and $k_{start} > k_{stop}$.
4. Take the mean of $l$ and $r$.


## Implementation

My initial solution is


```{.python include="median_two_sorted_arrays.py" snippet="solution"}
```
