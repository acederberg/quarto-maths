Hello readers! 

In this blog post I will be demonstrating how to deploy your static ``quarto`` 
blog to ``kubernetes`` using manifests. If your blog needs ``quarto serve``
this approach will not serve your purposes.

This blog post will go into great detail as there does not appear to be a high
degree of intersection between users of ``kubernetes`` and notebooks like 
``quarto``. For example, this blog post will give you a starting point if you
have little understanding ``kubernetes`` and outline some of the things that 
will be required to deploy your app that might be taken for granted if the 
primary audience were seasoned users of ``kubernetes``.

I would first recommend that you look at the articles about containerization of 
``quarto`` with ``docker`` (and if it floats your boat making a 
``docker-compose`` project for the development of your ``quarto`` website). 
There will soon be subsequent articles about deploying your ``quarto`` app to 
``kubernetes`` in ``pulumi``, a wonderful infrastructure as code (IaC) tool 
that is a complete alternative to ``terraform`` that avoids the many pitfalls 
of domain specific languages.

Deploying your quarto notebooks is an excellent way to build a portfolio. 
One may show of their cool data science projects, write how to articles, and
render mathematics documents using ``TeX``. 

Further, your notebooks do not need to contain executable code cells for them 
to be published to your blog. For instance, this document is rendered as part 
of a quarto blog deployed roughly as stated in this article and only uses the
``markdown`` feature of quarto.


## Choosing a Kubernetes Cluster 

First of all, you will need a ``kubernetes`` cluster. This can be accomplished a
number of ways and the specifics are far beyond the scope of this blog post. 
However, a few good places to start are:

- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) - A cloud free solution. This
  will allow one to run a cluster locally on their own machine. If you're just 
  seeing if it is possible to deploy your quarto site, then I would recommend 
  this as it is the cheapest. *(all you need is electricity!)*

- [Linode Kuberenetes Engine](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/) - By 
  far the cheapest cloud based option. It is as complete as any of the other 
  cloud options mentioned here. The only drawback is that you might have to
  deploy your own ingress controller (for instance [traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-ingress/) 
  or the [``nginx`` ingress controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) 
  to direct traffic to your deployment. **I will probably write a blog post on
  this matter soon.**

- [Azure Kubernetes Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/) - This 
  is probably overkill for an experiment, and I would not recommend ``azure`` 
  for your experimental deployments as there are many options to get web 
  traffic to your ``kubernetes`` deployment that can become very expensive (for 
  instance the azure application gateway).


## Building a Container Image

In my blogpost about building a ``docker`` image you can find out how to
``containerize`` your ``quarto`` project. There are a few important 
assumptions about your project:

1. The quarto project should not use ``shiny`` and should not require the use
   of ``quarto serve``. I will probably write a blog post about this once I 
   have to deploy such a thing myself.
2. The quarto project container has been published to dockerhub using the tag
   ``{your-dockerhub-username}/quarto-blog:latest``. 
3. The container will serve the ``quarto`` website on port ``8080``.


## Install the Kubernetes Command Line Client

``kubernetes`` is communicated with via an HTTP API - this means that there are
a number of means to talk to the API - for instance 

- [python client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python) - If you want
  to write some automation in ``python``.
- [go client](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) - If you want to 
  write some automation in ``go``.
- [command line client](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - This is the 
  option we will be using today. The ``YAML`` manifests written in this 
  document will require some extra work to deploy using the other clients, for 
  instance [see this stack exchange post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58783939/using-client-go-to-kubectl-apply-against-the-kubernetes-api-directly-with-mult).

Further, it is even possible to use the API using ``curl`` or ``python``s 
``requests`` or ``httpx`` library - I would not recommend it.

Once you think you have installed the ``kubectl`` command line client, run

```sh
kubectl version --output=yaml
```

to ensure that the client is working. This should give you something like

```yaml
clientVersion:
  buildDate: "2024-05-14T10:50:53Z"
  compiler: gc
  gitCommit: 6911225c3f747e1cd9d109c305436d08b668f086
  gitTreeState: clean
  gitVersion: v1.30.1
  goVersion: go1.22.2
  major: "1"
  minor: "30"
  platform: linux/amd64
kustomizeVersion: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
serverVersion:
  buildDate: "2024-03-14T23:58:36Z"
  compiler: gc
  gitCommit: 6813625b7cd706db5bc7388921be03071e1a492d
  gitTreeState: clean
  gitVersion: v1.29.3
  goVersion: go1.21.8
  major: "1"
  minor: "29"
  platform: linux/amd64
```
 
Next, ensure that you are connected to the cluster that you want to deploy to.
This can be done like

```sh
kubectl config get-context
```

and should give a response something like

```default
CURRENT   NAME            CLUSTER     AUTHINFO          NAMESPACE
*         lkeXXXXXX-ctx   lkeXXXXXX   lkeXXXXXX-admin   *
```


## Kubernetes Manifests

A ``kubernetes`` manifest is just a ``YAML`` file that is interpretted by the 
``kubectl`` client and transformed into API calls. This will result in the 
creation of resources on your ``kubernetes`` cluster.


### Creating a Namespace

First, in a new file ``quarto-blog.yaml``, we will create a ``namespace``, 
which will help keep the objects created separate from any existing resources:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: quarto-blog
```

then run 

```sh
kubectl apply -f quarto-blog.yaml
```

This will instantiate the namespace within your ``kubernetes`` cluster. To see 
verify namespace was created, run

```sh
kubectl get ns
```

and finally, run 

```sh
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=quarto-blog
```

This will make sure that ``kubectl get`` will look in the ``quarto-blog`` 
namespace. 


### Creating a Deployment

Now a ``Deployment`` can be added to the new ``Namespace``. A deployment is a 
self healing set of ``Pods`` (which are groups of containers). This means that 
when a pod dies or is directly removed, it will be replaced by a new one by the 
deployment.

```yaml
# Also in ``quarto-blog.yaml``
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  namespace: quarto-blog
  name: quarto-blog
kind: Deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: quarto-blog
  template:
    metadata: 
      labels:
        app: quarto-blog
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: quarto-blog
          image: "{your-dockerhub-username}/quarto-blog:latest"
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          ports: 
            - name: captura-http
              containerPort: 8080
          readinessProbe:
            failureThreshold: 3
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: 8080
              scheme: HTTP
            periodSeconds: 10
            successThreshold: 1
            timeoutSeconds: 1
```

There are noteworthy aspects of this manifest:

- A new ``YAML`` document is started in ``quarto-blog.yaml`` by writing ``---``
  on its own line.
- The ``spec.selector.matchLabels`` should be some subset of ``spec.template.metadata.labels``.
- It is necessary to tell ``kubernetes`` the port that this will be hosted on.
- The ``readinessProbe`` field will check to make sure that the site is being 
  successfully served. 

Once again, use ``kubectl apply -f ./quarto-blog.yaml`` to start up your 
``Deployment``. If everything goes right, running

```sh
kubectl get deployments
```

should display 

```default
NAME          READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
quarto-blog   1/1     1            1           2d20h
```

If the ``Ready`` column does not show ``1/1`` the following section will aid 
in debugging.


### Debugging the Deployment

If things do not go smoothly, some solutions to likely cases are provided here.
To get more specifics of what went wrong, run

```sh
kubectl get pods --selector app=quarto-blog
```

If the image provided in the manifest is not found, the output of 
``kubectl get deployments`` will be like

```default
NAME                           READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
{name of pod}                  0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          98s
```

In this case, go inspect your ``hub.docker.com`` repository and click on the 
``latest`` tag (or the tag you desire). The image name to use should be on the 
page:

![Dockerhub image name](./dockerhub-imgname.png){.no-filter}


If your pod(s) are crashing (that is, they have the value ``CrashLoopBackOff`` 
in the ``STATUS`` column), like 

```default
NAME                           READY   STATUS             RESTARTS        AGE
quarto-blog-75cf7b96c6-7n8m7   0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   8 (2m58s ago)   19m
```

then ``kubectl describe pod/{name of pod}`` and ``kubectl logs {name of pod}`` 
can help point you towards any server failures.


### Creating a Service

A service determines how your pods will be grouped and when their traffic is 
routed to the internet. The ingress controller will use services to route 
traffic thus services are necessary. In this instance, only the pods from 
``quarto-blog`` are to be selected. To do this the following must be added
to ``quarto-blog.yaml``:

```yaml
# Also in ``quarto-blog.yaml``
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: quarto-blog
  namespace: quarto-blog
spec:
  selector:
    app: quarto-blog
  ports:
    - targetPort: 8080
      port: 80
```

this will route all of the traffic from port ``8080`` of the pods to port 
``80`` of the service. Once again ``kubectl apply -f quarto-blog.yaml`` and 
verify that the service exists and is properly function with 
``kubectl get services``.


### Routing

In my particular case, I have decided to use ``traefik`` as my ingress 
controller. Setting up ``traefik`` in ``kubernetes`` with ``letsencrypt`` can be 
a pain, and I will go into the details in a subsequent blog post. The following
assumes that 

1. ``traefik`` and its custom resource definitions have been added to 
   ``kubernetes``. 
3. ``traefik`` has a certificate resolver ``letsencrypt``.
2. That your website is ``example.io``.

``traefik`` will respond to http ``traefik`` on ``blog.example.io`` with the 
response from the ``quarto-blog`` service when provided the following 
additional manifest in ``quarto-blog.yaml``:

```yaml
---
- apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Middleware
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: "2024-05-23T18:08:33Z"
    generation: 1
    labels:
      acederberg.io/component: traefik
      acederberg.io/from: pulumi
      acederberg.io/tier: base
    name: traefik-ratelimit
    namespace: traefik
    resourceVersion: "299631"
    uid: a2353bac-a511-4118-bbb0-8b2ad989f938
  spec:
    rateLimit:
      average: 100
      burst: 200

---
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: quarto-blog
  namespace: quarto-blog
spec:
  tls:
    certResolver: letsencrypt
  entryPoints:
    - websecure
  routes:
    - kind: Rule
      match: HOST(`blog.example.io`)
      middlewares:
        - name: traefik-ratelimit
          namespace: traefik
      services:
        - kind: Service
          name: quarto-blog
          namespace: quarto-blog
          port: 80
```


Now ``kubectl apply -f quarto-blog.yaml``. Finally, browse to the matched host 
and your webpage should appear with valid https:

![Deployed blog](./blog.png){.no-filter}


## Removal

If you would like to undo all of the actions in this article, do

```default
kubectl delete -f ./quarto-blog.yaml
```
