I found a fun US housing dataset published by ``robikscube`` on kaggle. It is a 
compilation of data from zillows estimates and can be found [on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/zillow-home-value-index)

```{python}
#| echo: false
%run ./index.py
```

```{.python include="index.py" snippet="setup"}
```


With this the data can be obtained and we can take a quick peek. Let's look at
some states in the southwest:


```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

data_path, _ = get_data()
data = load_data(data_path)
data[["New Mexico", "Arizona", "Colorado", "Utah", "Texas"]].tail()
```


The data is already sorted by datetimes, which are the index. The 
``clean_data`` function will add ``year`` and ``month`` and rename the columns
to lower snake case so that they may be accessed as dataframe attributes:


```{python}
data_train, data_test = split_data(clean_data(data))
data_test[["month", "year", "new_mexico", "arizona"]].tail() 
```

i
Now we can create a plot of a few selected states:


```{python}
def plot_selected(*states: str):
  if not states:
    states = ["new_mexico", "colorado", "arizona", "utah", "texas"] 

  figure, ax = plt.subplots()
  data_train[states].plot(ax=ax)
  plt.close()
  figure.savefig("./prices-selected-train.png")

  return

plot_selected()

```
