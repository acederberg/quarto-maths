To deploy my blog and to deploy some future projects, I decided I would like to
set up infrastructure as code using `Pulumi` {{< iconify logos pulumi >}} for
`linode` {{< iconify logos linode >}}.

[The blog](/projects/blog) has continuous integration and deployment setup using
github actions, which you can read more about [here](/projects/blog/deploy.html).

I quite prefer `pulumi` over terraform {{< iconify logos terraform >}}, though
both are quite similar in application _(for more on why, see [why I prefer pulumi](./why-pulumi.qmd).)_.
