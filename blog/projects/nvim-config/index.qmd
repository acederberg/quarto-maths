Thank you to [quarto-nvim-kickstarter](https://github.com/jmbuhr/quarto-nvim-kickstarter)
for giving me some ideas where to start with quarto in nvim!

This is a mix of things incorporated from the kick-starter and my already existing configuration.

## Features

- Completion, fixing, syntax, and diagnostics in standalone files within
  [quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-nvim) and `markdown` code
  blocks for `python`, `go`, `lua`, `javascript`, `julia`, `r`, `markdown`,
  `yaml` and `json` using

  - [cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) for completion.
  - [quarto.nvim](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-nvim) and [otter.nvim](https://github.com/jmbuhr/otter.nvim) for quarto highlighting and injected syntax.
  - [conform.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim) for fixing bad formatting.

- Nice highlighting for `mermaid` and `dot` diagrams in `markdown` and `quarto`.
- Comment toggling and untoggling with [comment.nvim](https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim).
- Git integration with [diffview](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim).
- Nice statusbar with [lualine](https://github.com/acederberg/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim).
- Whitespace trimming and highlighting with [whitespace.nvim](https://github.com/johnfrankmorgan/whitespace.nvim).
- My favorite colorschmes including [kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim),
  [gruvbox](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material), an
  [solarized](https://github.com/maxmx03/solarized.nvim).

## Installation

The following instructions assume that you have successfully installed a
recent version of `nvim`. If you want to use this in entirety and want to
do nothing else do

```sh
mdkir ~/.config/nvim
git clone <repo_url> ~/.config/nvim
echo "source ~/.config/nvim/<repo-name>/init.lua" >> init.lua
```

## Adding to Documentation

It is important to note that all changes to docs should be pulled into the `docs`
branch. The docs branch was created using `filter-branch` as follows:

```sh
git checkout -b docs
git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter docs HEAD
```
