In the section of my blog content, I discuss the implementation of this blog
itself as it has been quite a project to do so.
This is my blog that you are likely viewing this on.
In my time making this, I have learned quite a bit about [quarto](https://quarto.org),
an amazing markup format for websites, jupyter notebooks, books, articles, and more.
All content on this blog is authored using quarto.

In this time, I have also had quite some fun figuring out how to to implement

- continuous integration and continuous deployment for this project using github actions {{< iconify logos github-actions>}},
- a `docker` image that accomodates `kaggle` api calls and mounting of other secrets duing the build using secrets,
- and how to create diagrams with [mermaid <span data-icon="misc:mermaid" class="iconify"></span>](https://mermaid.js.org) and [iconify](https://iconify.design).

Further, there are associated projects (in the sidebar) that support this project.
For instance

- the [my neovim configuration](../nvim-config/index.qmd) is designed to make editing `quarto` documents very easy,
- and the [infrastructure and automation project](../automation) is used to [deploy](./deploy.qmd) the infrastructure to linode {{< iconify logos linode >}}.

## Why Have a Blog?

I have always been really into taking notes, so I thought it would be good to get away from paper.
Working with web pages offers much more flexibility a features than using paper notes and allows me to share them with ease.

### About `leetcode`

Data structures and algorithms is a useful subject matter to be knowledgable about in computer science and software.
Additionally, the subject matter is frequently quized in SDE technical interviews.
Since I am currently applying for jobs and working on `leetcode` problems, I figured I should start to do some for practice.
I also wanted to have a record of the problem which I had done and to take more extensive notes on the things that I did not understand or found interesting.

### About the Resume

I thought it might be helpful to have all of the resumes I distribute contain a link to the most recent version of [my resume](/resume) :zap:.
To make this possible, I would have to host it somewhere and thought my blog would be the most suitable place.
This came with a number of benefits, such as

- having version control over my resume,
- rendering into multiple formats like `TeX`, `PDF`, and `HTML`,
- integration of the resume into something I'd be working on frequently,
- being able to edit in my favorite tool `nvim` instead of [overleaf](https://overleaf.com),
- having the projects described in the resume have corresponding pages on the same website,
- having auxilary content available for the resume when everything might not fit.

### About the Projects

I've made a few projects (including this blog) which I wanted to showcase here.
Each of these will have their own page dedicated them, and should be available in the sidebar.
For some of the larger projects there might be extensive documentation.
All of the content here is pulled from the various repositories using `git` subtrees.
To learn more about the technical details, see the next page.
