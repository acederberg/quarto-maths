In my time making this blog, I have learned quite a bit about [quarto](https://quarto.org) {{< iconify misc quarto >}},
an amazing markup and notebook format for websites, jupyter notebooks, books, articles, and more.
Almost all blog pages and navigation in this blog is authored using quarto.

I have also had quite some fun figuring out how to to implement

- continuous integration and continuous deployment for this project using github actions {{< iconify logos github-actions>}},
- a `docker` {{< iconify logos docker-icon >}} image that accomodates `kaggle` {{< iconify logos kaggle >}} api calls and mounting of other secrets duing the build using secrets,
- and how to create diagrams with [mermaid {{< iconify misc mermaid >}}](https://mermaid.js.org) and [iconify](https://iconify.design).

### Project Navigation is Available in the Sidebar

There are associated projects that support this project which can view in the sidebar.
For instance

- the [my neovim configuration](../nvim-config/index.qmd) is designed to make editing `quarto` documents very easy,
- and the [infrastructure and automation project](../automation) where [pulumi {{< iconify logos pulumi-icon >}}](https://pulumi.com/) and `python` {{< iconify logos python >}} are used to [deploy](./deploy.qmd) the infrastructure to linode {{< iconify logos linode >}}.

## The Tools That Make it Possible

Thank you to all of the contributors to the tools I have used that made this possible at all!
I cannot emphasize enought that without the tremendous efforts of the open source community (in particular) that this would not be possible at all.
Click on any of the icons below to see a brief description of how each tool is utilitized here.

:::::: { #thank-you-tools }

<!-- start overlay --> ::::: { .overlay #thank-you-overlay }
<!-- start overlay-content --> :::: { .overlay-content }

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="quarto" }

Quarto is an excellent code notebook built on top of pandoc.
It can convert `.qmd` documents to
<iconify-icon icon="devicon:latex"></iconify-icon> `latex`,
<iconify-icon icon="devicon:html5"></iconify-icon> `html`, and more.
It is the backbone of this project and most of the documents
presented are rendered `.qmd` documents and some pandoc filters.

:::

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="latex" }

Without TeX, I would have to write my resume in Microsoft word.
Since I do all of my work on a linux machine, I could have used libre
word, however I generally like not to use such tools since they do
not produce documents that play well with git
{{< iconify devicon git >}}.

**Using a GUI text editor - This is one of the few fates I believe to
be worse than death.**

:::

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="pulumi" }

Pulumi is a great infrastructure as code tool available in most
popular lanugages. I use it to provision the kubernetes cluster
that this blog runs on and set up paripheral resources. I also use
it to manage kubernetes resources, such as traefik and the error
pages. <iconify-icon icon="logos:kubernetes"></iconify-icon>

:::

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="github" }

Github is where I host all of my code.

:::

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="git" }

Git is a fantastic tool for version control.
Without version control, software development would be very tedious.
It allows me to make experimental changes and revert to my last point
in my work and maintain multiple working versions of the same
project.

:::

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="neovim" }

My favorite tool for text editing.

Neovim is my prefered development environment as it integrates nicely into work through the terminal.

:::

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="python" }

The primary language I use in my quarto notebooks.
Python is by far my favorite high level programming languages.
Many of the scripts used to develop, deploy, and test this site are written in `python`.

:::

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="nodejs" }

My server uses `http-server` to deliver these html pages.
Additional, plenty of vanilla (browser) javascript is used to make this website interactive,
for instance to show you this overlay without clunky refreshing.

:::

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="mermaid" }

Mermaid is an excellent tool for creating diagrams using javascript.

:::

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="linode" }

Linode is a minimal cloud platform on which the kubernetes {{< iconify logos kubernetes >}} cluster
this blog runs in is hosted.

:::

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="kubernetes" }

This website is served from kubernetes. Further, all routing, middleware, and
SSL termination for the `acederberg.io` domain is done through `kubernetes`
using `traefik`.

:::

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="pandas" }

This is my favorite tool for loading an manipulating datasets in
python {{< iconify devicon python >}}.

:::

<!--
::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="kaggle" }

The data science competition platform.

There is a section of this site dedicated to my kaggle assignments.

:::
-->

::: { .overlay-content-item data-key="docker" }

The containerization technology used to gaurentee consistent builds
in github actions and a uniform development environment.
