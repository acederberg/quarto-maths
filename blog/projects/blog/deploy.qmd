The blog is deployed onto infrastructure provisioned by another project listed
here, [see the automation project](./projects/automation). To provide a nice
diagram:

```{=html}

<pre class="mermaid">
architecture-beta
  group linode(logos:linode)[Linode]
  service blog_deployment(k8s:svc)[Blog Service and Deployment] in linode
  service kubernetes(k8s:svc)[Kubernetes] in linode
</pre>

```

```
  %% service load_balancer(server)[Traefik Ingress] in linode
  %% group github(logos:github-icon)[Github]
  %% group github_actions(logos:github-actions) in github
  %% service actions_check(gitlab:document)[Check Code] in github_actions
  %% service actions_build(gitlab:document)[CI/CD] in github_actions
  %% service actions_entity(gitlab:user)[Developer] in github_actions

  %% service github_actions_check(logi
```

By the way, this diagram was made possible using [`mermaid` architecture diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/architecture.html).
Also, these diagrams can be written directly in `quarto` documents, yet another reason why `quarto` is great.
