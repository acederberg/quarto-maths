## Versioning and Fixing Workflow

Versioning is done pretty loosly. So far I mostly use it for

1. Tagging points in the git <span class="iconify" data-icon="logos:git"></span>
   history where substantial changes to the structure of the project are made.
2. Substantial changes to github actions <span class="iconify" data-icon="logo:github-actions"></span>
   or containerization <span class="iconify" data-icon="logo:docker"></span>.
