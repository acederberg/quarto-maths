Here I would like to describe how I have automated builds for [my blog](https://acederberg.io).
If you know me, you know I love containerization and linux - lately I've also been quite obsessed with quarto.

## {{< iconify logo docker >}} The Dockerfile

I have written a multistage `dockerfile` so that the final container is relatively
lightweight and does not contain all quarto and all of its dependencies.
The only responsibility of the final image produced is to serve the static files
rendered by `quarto`, including this very blog post.

```{mermaid}
architecture-beta
  group builder()[Build Stage]
  group production(devicon:nodejs)[Production Stage]


```
