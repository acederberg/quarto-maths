The `iframes` filter make it easy to embed another page into the current page.
For instance the following:

::: { #links-pdf-iframe }

:::

::: { .callout-note collapse=false }

## Filter Configuration: PDF In an `iframe`

It is extemely easy to configure, only requiring a path (from the project root)
to the target file, the render result type, and an identifier. For instance
the document above is rendered by specifying a div with the the appropriate

```qmd
::: { #contacts-pdf-iframe }

:::
```

and the following `YAML` front matter:

```{ include="_metadata.yaml" snippet=1}

```
