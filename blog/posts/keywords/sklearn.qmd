title: SKLean Text Feature Extraction Notes
---

While contemplating how to compare keywords in documents I decided to ask
`Chat-GPT` what it thought on the matter. One of the tools it mentioned
was included in `SKLearn` and thus I will be taking a look at that here:

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

```{python}
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

documents = [
    "Python is great for data science and machine learning.",
    "Machine learning and AI are transforming the world.",
    "Software development relies on Python and AI.",
]

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

# Compute cosine similarity between documents
similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix)
print(similarity_matrix)
```
