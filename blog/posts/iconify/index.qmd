Recently I wanted to use [mermaid.js <span class="iconify" data-icon="misc:mermaid"></span>](https://mermaid.js.org) to make an
[architecture diagram](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/architecture.html) to
describe my infrastructure I am currently using to deploy
[my blog](https://acederberg.io).

In particular, I wanted to use the `SVG` icons defined in the [`kubernetes` community `github` repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/icons/svg)
inside of my architecture diagram. However, I could not find a suitable icon set.
To this end I made my own and would like to showcase the methods that I used.

After figuring out how to wrestle the `SVG` icons into a properly formatted `JSON` I was able to generate
awesome diagrams using `kubernetes` icons such as the one below in @fig-architecture-diagram
and icons like that seen in the header of this section (the {{< iconify misc mermaid >}} `mermaid.js` symbol).

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-architecture-diagram
%%| fig-cap: Diagram made with mermaid using the custom icon set.
architecture-beta
  group kubernetes(logos:kubernetes)
  group ns(k8s:ns)[Blog Namespace] in kubernetes

  group blog_service(k8s:svc)[Blog Service] in ns
  service blog_deployment(k8s:deployment)[Blog Deployment] in blog_service
  service blog_ingressroute(k8s:crd)[Traefik Production IngressRoute] in ns
  blog_ingressroute:L --> R:blog_deployment{group}

  group blog_service_preview(k8s:svc)[Blog Service Preview] in ns
  service blog_deployment_preview(k8s:deployment)[Blog Deployment Preview] in blog_service_preview
  service blog_ingressroute_preview(k8s:crd)[Traefik Production IngressRoute] in ns
  blog_ingressroute_preview:L --> R:blog_deployment_preview{group}

## {{< iconify hugeicons question >}} Objective

::: { #fig-example-json }

```json
{
  "prefix": "myprefix",
  "icons": {
    "myicon": {
      "body": "<g></g>",
      "height": 17,
      "width": 17
    }
  }
}
```

General shape of the `iconify` icon set `JSON`.

:::

The goal is to take the `SVG` content and turn it into a string inside of some `JSON` like that in @fig-example-json.
Every value inside of `$.icons` should at least have a `body` field containing `SVG` data.
The exact `JSON` schema may be found [on iconify.design](https://iconify.design/docs/types/iconify-json.html).

::: { .callout-note }

As you will see bellow, the only thing this has to with `iconify` is the `JSON` schema used by `mermaid`.
It would appear that `mermaid` does not use `iconify` under the hood and therefore icon sets that work in `mermaid` may not work with `iconify` {{< iconify poop >}}.

:::

### Gotchas

There were a number of things that I found unintuitive while writing the script
and getting the icon set to work.

::: { .callout-warning }

#### `body` Should Not be Wrapped in `SVG`

It turns out that having the `SVG` tag inside of the `body` results in the icons not loading.
My solution was to use `python`s built in `xml` library to parse out the
content that was only the same. In the case of the `kubernetes` icons I had to find
an element `layer1` to extract from the `xml`.

In `python`, this is done like

```python
from xml.dom import minidom

loaded = minidom.parse(str(path))
elements = loaded.getElementsByTagName("g")
element = next((ee for ee in elements if ee.getAttribute("id") == "layer1"), None)
```

A big part of debugging was parsing the `xml` files to query the right piece
of code.

:::

::: { .callout-warning }

#### Certain `SVG` Icons will not Be Accepted by Iconify

Some icons contain `SVG` incompatible with `iconify`.
**However, such icons will often work with mermaid**
Since I only really want these icons for `mermaid` I do not care, however,
I found that certain icons (in my case `k8s:limits` make `iconify`) unable to use the whole image set.

<!--
The code reproducing this is below:

```{.html include="iconify.html"}

```

For those curious, the minimal content to reproduce the error is [is available here](./iconify.html).
Deleting `limits` and its associated alias fix the problem and then the `k8s:node` icon can be foundd.
-->

::: { .callout-warning }

#### All that is Necessary is a Properly Formatted `JSON` File.

You do not need to build your own `CDN` or use the `iconify` API unless you
would like to distribute the icon set to others.

:::

## {{< iconify logos python >}} The Script

After all of these considerations, I cooked up a `python` script to process all of the
`SVG` icons and turn them into a nice `JSON` file.

First, install the dependencies like:

```python
pip install typer requests
```

and then choose from one of the two setups described below.

### Build using API Key {#setup-standalone}

My best solution was to copy all of the files using the `pull` command instead
of cloning the entire repo as in [the alternative setup](#setup-cloned).

1. Copy the script in @fig-script and paste it into `iconify.py`.
2. Read the instructions in the [section on the code snippet](#the-build-script)
   for removing the small internal dependencies and replace them as specified.
3. Get an appropriate `github` token. This token should be very minimal as it is
   included only to bypass API rate limiting by `github`.
   Export the token like `export GH_TOKEN="<my-gh-token-goes-here>"`.
4. Pull the raw `SVG`s from `github` using the pull command and then use the
   4 make command to build the icon set:

   ```sh
   python ./iconify.py pull
   python ./iconify.py make
   ```

### Building from Cloned Repo { #setup-cloned}

::: { .callout-warning }

No longer recommended. See instead (the standalone setup)[#setup-standalone}

:::

1. Clone the [`kubernetes` community repo](https://github.com/kubernetes),
   For instance

   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/kubernetes/community
   ```

2. Copy the build script in @fig-script into the repo under `icons/tools/iconify.py`,
3. Read the instructions in [the section on the code snippet](#the-build-script) for removing the
   small internal dependencies and replace them as specified.
4. Run the build command:

   ```sh
   python ./icons/tools/iconify.py make
   ```

### The Build Script {#the-build-script}

```{=html}
<style>
  .scrollable pre {
    height: 720px;
    overflow: scroll !important;
  }
</style>
```

::: { #fig-script .scrollable }

```{ .python include="../../../acederbergio/iconify.py"}

```

Script for building the `iconify` icon set.

:::

To learn about the dependencies in the `acederbergio` package, see
[the github repository for this website](https://github.com/acederberg/quarto-maths).
To replace the two internal dependencies, just replace `env.require` with
`os.env["GH_TOKEN"]` and `util.print_yaml` with `print` and remove the
`acederbergio` import statements.

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/acederberg/quarto-maths/blob/main/acederbergio/iconify.py).

#### `typer`

`typer` makes it easy to run the script with flags and subcommands.

1. The `make` subcommand will create the `JSON` output.
   It can limit the number of icons process using `--include` and set the output destination using `--output`.

   For instance, in the [cloned setup](#setup-cloned) the icon set with only
   the `svc`, `etcd`, and `limits` icon can be built like

   ```sh
   #| fig-cap: This assumes that the shell is currently in the root of the cloned community repo.
   python ./icons/tools/iconify.py \
     make --include svc \
       --include etcd \
       --include limits \
       --output iconify.json
   ```

   and will be output to `./iconify.json`.

2. The `names` will print all of the icon names.
3. The `aliases` command will print `$.aliases` and also has `--include`.

It might seem overkill, but this was extremely convenient to pick out some bugs
while building the `iconset`.

::: {.callout-note}

The `JSON` output is available [on this website](/icons/kubernetes.json).

:::

## {{< iconify hugeicons checkmark-circle-02 >}} Using the Icon Set in Mermaid

::: { .callout-note }

It is possible to use the icon set with `iconify` in pure `HTML`.
However, for the reasons already state above, I will not be going into the details of this here.
This is described [within the `iconify` documentation](https://iconify.design/docs/icon-components/svg-framework/).
For those interested using `iconify` in quarto, see [the iconify extension for quarto](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-iconify).

:::

### {{< iconify logos html >}} With Mermaid Inside of `HTML`

::: { .callout-note }

The code displayed below is available as webpage [here](./mermaid.html).

:::

To get the icons working with `mermaid`, include `mermaid` and use `mermaid.registerIconPacks`.
Then write out the declarative code for your diagram inside of some `pre` tags with `class=mermaid`:

```{.html include="./mermaid.html"}

```

### With Mermaid Inside Of Quarto

It is as simple as adding something like the script tags from above to `quarto` `HTML`
output, e.g. make a file `./includes/mermaid.html` that calls `mermaid.registerIconPacks`:

```{.html include="../../includes/mermaid.html" snippet="script"}

```

and include it in the html output by using `format.html.include-in-header`:

````{quarto}
---
format:
  html:
    include-in-header:
      - file: ./includes/mermaid.html
---

This is an example, and the following diagram should be rendered by mermaid
in the browser:

```{mermaid}
architecture-beta
  group linode(logos:linode)[Linode]
  service blog_deployment(k8s:svc)[Blog Service and Deployment] in linode
```

````

The diagram rendered should look like

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-cap: The final product.
%%| label: fig-diagram-final

architecture-beta
  group linode(logos:linode)[Linode]
  service blog_deployment(k8s:svc)[Blog Service and Deployment] in linode
```
