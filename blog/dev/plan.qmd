Ideally renders should be scheduled in a queue.

```{mermaid}

    participant Client
    participant WEBSOCKET
    participant POST
    participant Handler
    participant MongoDB

    Client->>POST: Request Render
    POST->>MongoDB: Enqueue Job
    WEBSOCKET-->>MongoDB: Websocket Reads Scheduled Job
    WEBSOCKET->>Client: Client Sees Scheduled Job
    MongoDB->>Handler: Render Job is Dequeued
    Handler->>Handler: Render Job is Processed
    Handler->>MongoDB: Completed Job Recorded in MongoDB
    WEBSOCKET->>MongoDB: Websocket Sees Completed Job
    WEBSOCKET->>Client: Client Sees Completed Job
```
