The problem statement may be found [on leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-transform-of-an-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-02).


## Analysis

A trivial solution would just take all values in the input, sort all unique 
values, define their rank as their positions in the array, and return the 
initial array as the image of these.


## Solution

### Trivial Solution

The trivial solution performs shockingly well. Over two submissions it 
performed both very well and very poorly - it would appear that the 
distribution is stochastic. The best submission got a $98\%$ in terms of 
runtime and a $26\%$ in terms of memory. The worst got $24\%$ in terms of 
runtime and a $45\%$ in terms of memory. The solution is as follows:
