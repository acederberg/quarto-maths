## Analysis


Divide and conquer! This is obviously a dynamic programming question.


```default
Main problem becomes subproblems

      2+3*5-4 -> 2+3*(5-4)
     /       \
(2+3)*5-4    2+(3*5)-4


The subproblems become complete expressions:


         (2+3)*5-4           
          /     \             
(2+3)*(5-4)    ((2+3)*5)-4
          =5             =21
 
         2+(3*5)-4        
          /     \             
(2+(3*5))-4     2+((3*5)-4)
          =13             =13


         2+3*(5-4) 
        /         \
2+(3*(5-4))       (2+3)*(5-4)
          =5                =5


```
