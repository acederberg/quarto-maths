title: Data Structures and Algorithms Problems
description: |
  Here I share my notes on data structures an algorithms. Such problems are 
  common part of technical interviews for software developers and can provide
  insight into how to write performant code. Some subsections here are actually
  collections of articles, for instance the ``leetcode`` section.
