[View the live version of the resume](/resume).

I thought it would be fun and useful to make an `HTML` version of my resume so that I could go into more detail about particular subjects than in the `PDF` resume I would typically submit during job applications.
Fortunately, `quarto` {{< iconify misc quarto >}} is capable of rendering `pandoc` markdown into both formats and is incredibly extensible using filters.
Using `quarto` and some `pandoc` filters, I made an interactive resume viewable within the browser that aims to guide the view using nice graphics.

## Advantages of Multiple Formats

### For the Reader

- It is a better experience to look through a website than to read another `PDF`.
  Styling and interactivity of websites is not nearly as limited as a `PDF` document.
- It provides an immediate example of my skills in something relevent to software.
- A link to the most recent version of my resume is provided in all `PDF` resumes.

### For My Self

- Version control.
- Integration into something I'd be working on frequently.
- Editting in my favorite tool `nvim` instead of [overleaf](https://overleaf.com).
- If I do not have my computer on hand, I can just send somebody a link instead of emailing them a `PDF`.
