::: { #resume-profile .py-5 }

I am a software engineer and development operations engineer with success in
building software as a service from scratch, developing APIs, quality assurance
and containerization, enhancing and automating developer workflows and
productivity, and architecting highly reliable deployments and infrastructure.

I have a background in mathematics and engineering and very high standards for my own work.
Some of my favorite technologies are `python`, `linux`, `docker`, `pulumi`, and `javascript`.
