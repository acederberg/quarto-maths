Researched air plasma generation for astronautics with Craig Davidson of
Dark Sea Industries.

- Documented efficient air plasma generation using magneto-fluid-dynamic methods.
  Built various components for experimental setup including magnetic venturi
  and power supply array to define electrodynamic environment
  by passing current through large magnets composing the magnetic venturi.
- Recorded experimental session IR and magnetic and electric field data using
  a multiplexed `I2C` array controlled by a raspberry pi with code developed in
  `python` and `c`.
- Processed and plotted experimental data using `numpy` and `matplotlib` to
  document findings.
