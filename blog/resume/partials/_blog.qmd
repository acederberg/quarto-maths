Without GPT mods

Starting blogging about topics in data science, data structures and algorithms,
and development operations to share insights, expertise, and progress.
Built [acederberg.io](https://aceederberg.io/projects/blog) using `quarto`
and `python` to showcase `30+` blog posts, `4` projects, resume, and
professional portfolio.

- Achieved `>99%` reliability of [acederberg.io](https://acederberg.io) and
  reliable deployment and builds via infrastructure as code with `pulumi` on
  `linode` and `github` actions.
- Developed additional components for [acederberg.io](https://acederberg.io)
  to enhance content clarity and reactivity using `pandoc` filters implemented
  in `python` with `pydantic`, including additional `javascript` and extended
  `SCSS` built upon `bootstrap`.
- Expedited authorship for [acederbergio](https://acederberg.io) by creating
  a development dashboard and `typer` CLI to provide visibility into
  `pandoc` filter and `http` server logs using `FastAPI`, `websockets`, UNIX
  domain sockets, and `mongodb`.
- Contributed to `github` open source community by raising and resolving issues,
  especially through `quarto` and its associated projects.
