          description: |
            I have been seriously writing code since about 2017 (and a little
            before).

            Through my various projects I have developed habits condusive to
            building and shipping projects. I always:

            1. have a plan and a timeline,
            2. enforce effective design patterns and testing,
            3. and use version control.

            Data storage and retrieval is an essentail part of all modern web
            applications. I have plenty of experience developing APIs and ETLs
            in languages like
            ``python`` <iconify-icon icon="devicons:python"></iconify-icon>
            and ``nodejs`` <iconify-icon icon="devicons:nodejs"></iconify-icon>
            using database technologies such as
            ``mysql`` <iconify-icon icon=devicon:mysql></iconify-icon>,
            ``mongodb`` <iconify-icon icon=devicon:mongodb></iconify-icon>,
            and ``redis`` <iconify-icon icon=devicon:redis></iconify-icon>.

            For instance, you are probably viewing this resume on my blog.

            My blog uses a mix of server side rendering in ``python`` using
            ``quarto`` and ``panflute`` along with vanilla ``javascript``
            running in the browser to implement reactivity.

            A service is not useful or accessable unless it is deployed, and
            deploying a website manually is a thing of the past. Automation is
            mandatory for buliding reliable and secure products.

          value: Albuquerque, New Mexico
          description: |
            I currently reside in Albuquerque, New Mexico and have lived here
            since I was about seven years old.
            I quite like it here, but am open to relocate for the right
            position and compensation.

            My preferences are listed in descending order:

            1. A hybrid job here in Albuerque with and office in town or near by.
            2. A remote job where I can make occasional trips out of town to
               work in the office.
            3. A fully remote job.
            4. A fully on-premise job where relocation is provided.

            **I will not provide my full address here, this is included for
            resume parsers and the like so that they can begin do more for
            autofill.
            If you need my full address, please reach out to me by email or
            phone.**
