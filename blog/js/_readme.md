# Blog Javascript

All of the javascript used to make the blog interactive.
This is combined with ``quarto`` filters written using ``panflute`` to make
a number of interactive components, for instance

- [Overlay](/components/overlay),
- [Floaty](/components/floaty),
- and the development dashboard [Live](/components/live).


For now this documentation exists to showcase the work behind the scenes here.
Please excuse the lack of styling here.

[Module documentation may be found here](./modules.qmd).
